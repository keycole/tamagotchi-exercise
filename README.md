# Tamagotchi Spinoff Exercise
A basic clone of the Tamagotchi game that allows the user to play via command line prompts.

## Built With
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Dependencies**: [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)


## Installation
- After you clone the repository, navigate to the folder containing index.js and package.json in the terminal/bash and type the following in the command line: 
```javascript
npm install
```

- From there you should be set to start interacting with the basic game. To run, type the following in the command line:
```javascript
node index.js
```

## How to use
After typing node index.js into the command line, you will be prompted to answer some questions. 
- Choose your animal - current options are dog or cat.
- Choose your action from the list.
- If you would like to continue playing, answer yes to the continue play question. Answering no will terminate the program. 

## Contribute
You can expand the game by adding more animals using the DigitalPal constructor (follow the same pattern used on lines 84 & 85 in index.js). 

Try adding new functions to the constructor and updating the question prompts, too.

Have fun making the game your own!
